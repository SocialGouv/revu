## Git Diff - PRIMARY SOURCE FOR LINE TARGETING

**CRITICAL**: Use this diff as your PRIMARY reference for line numbers and positioning. All comments must target lines that appear in this diff.

```diff
{{{git_diff_branch}}}
```

## Modified Files (For Context Only)

The following files show the complete content after changes. Use these for understanding context, but rely on the Git Diff above for accurate line targeting.

{{#each modified_files}}

## Test Quality Anti-Patterns - CRITICAL DETECTION
### âœ… WHAT REAL TESTS SHOULD DO:
- Import actual functions/classes from source code
- Test real behavior, not mock behavior
- Use mocks only for external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.)
- Fail when source code logic changes

**PRIORITY**: Treat useless tests as CRITICAL bugs - they provide false confidence and zero protection against regressions.

## Review Instructions

### Comment Priority Levels
Only comment on issues that fall into these categories:

1. **CRITICAL** (Always comment):
   - Bugs or logic errors
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data corruption risks
   - Breaking changes

2. **IMPORTANT** (Comment if significant impact):
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Architectural problems
   - Maintainability concerns that affect team productivity
   - Violations of the coding guidelines above

3. **MINOR** (Skip unless severe):
   - Style preferences
   - Minor optimizations
   - Subjective improvements

### Comment Quality Rules

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NO positive-only comments** - Never comment just to say code is good
- **Actionable feedback only** - Every comment must suggest a specific improvement
- **Focus on changed code** - Only comment on lines that were modified in this PR
- **Minimum impact threshold** - Only comment if the issue significantly affects functionality, security, performance, or maintainability

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Aim for 3-7 high-impact comments maximum for a typical PR
- Skip redundant comments on similar issues
- Provide clear explanations of why the issue matters
- Include specific code suggestions when possible

## SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCKS - PRECISE CODE TARGETING

The system uses SEARCH/REPLACE blocks to automatically determine precise line positioning. You don't need to calculate line numbers manually - just provide accurate SEARCH blocks and the system will handle positioning.

## Code Suggestions - SEARCH/REPLACE Block Format

When providing code suggestions, use SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for precise modifications.

### SEARCH/REPLACE Block Requirements

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Exact Matching**: SEARCH content must match the file content character-for-character
2. **Sufficient Context**: Include enough surrounding lines to uniquely identify the location
3. **Complete Lines**: Each line in SEARCH blocks must be complete, never truncated

### Usage Examples

**Single Line Change:**
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils/helper.ts",
  "line": 15,
  "body": "This function should handle null values to prevent runtime errors.",
  "search_replace_blocks": [
    {
      "search": "  return user.name.toUpperCase()",
      "replace": "  return user?.name?.toUpperCase() ?? 'Unknown'"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-Line Change with Context:**
```json
{
  "path": "src/components/Form.tsx",
  "line": 25,
  "body": "Add proper error handling and validation to this form submission.",
  "search_replace_blocks": [
    {
      "search": "const handleSubmit = () => {\n  saveData(formData)\n  setLoading(false)\n}",
      "replace": "const handleSubmit = async () => {\n  try {\n    setLoading(true)\n    await saveData(formData)\n    setSuccess(true)\n  } catch (error) {\n    setError(error.message)\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n}"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: You can provide approximate line numbers - the system will automatically determine precise positioning based on your SEARCH blocks.

### Best Practices for SEARCH/REPLACE Blocks

- **Include Context**: Add 1-2 lines before/after the target code for unique identification
- **Match Exactly**: Copy the exact indentation, spacing, and formatting from the file
- **Test Mentally**: Verify your SEARCH block would uniquely match only the intended location
- **Order Correctly**: List multiple blocks in the order they appear in the file

### When NOT to Use SEARCH/REPLACE Blocks

- When you cannot see the exact code content to match
- For conceptual suggestions that don't involve specific code replacement
- When the change requires understanding broader context not visible in the diff

## Response Format Requirements

You MUST use the "provide_code_review" tool with:

### Summary Requirements
- Concise overview focusing on the most important aspects
- Highlight critical issues that need immediate attention
- Mention the overall quality and any patterns observed

### Comment Requirements
- **Specific file paths**: Match exactly as shown in the diff
- **Clear problem description**: Explain what's wrong and why it matters
- **Actionable solutions**: Provide concrete steps to fix the issue
- **SEARCH/REPLACE blocks**: Include when you can provide exact code fixes (the system will handle precise positioning)

## Important Notes

- **Focus on impact**: Only comment on issues that genuinely improve code quality
- **Provide exact SEARCH blocks**: The more precise your SEARCH content, the better the system can position your comments
- **Use sufficient context**: Include enough surrounding lines in SEARCH blocks to uniquely identify the location

Remember: The system handles line positioning automatically - focus on providing clear, actionable feedback with accurate SEARCH/REPLACE blocks.

## Git Diff - PRIMARY SOURCE FOR LINE TARGETING

**CRITICAL**: Use this diff as your PRIMARY reference for line numbers and positioning. All comments must target lines that appear in this diff.

```diff
{{{git_diff_branch}}}
```

## Modified Files (For Context Only)

The following files show the complete content after changes. Use these for understanding context, but rely on the Git Diff above for accurate line targeting.

{{#each modified_files}}

## Test Quality Anti-Patterns - CRITICAL DETECTION
### ✅ WHAT REAL TESTS SHOULD DO:
- Import actual functions/classes from source code
- Test real behavior, not mock behavior
- Use mocks only for external dependencies (APIs, databases, etc.)
- Fail when source code logic changes

**PRIORITY**: Treat useless tests as CRITICAL bugs - they provide false confidence and zero protection against regressions.

## Review Instructions

### Comment Priority Levels
Only comment on issues that fall into these categories:

1. **CRITICAL** (Always comment):
   - Bugs or logic errors
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Data corruption risks
   - Breaking changes

2. **IMPORTANT** (Comment if significant impact):
   - Performance bottlenecks
   - Architectural problems
   - Maintainability concerns that affect team productivity
   - Violations of the coding guidelines above

3. **MINOR** (Skip unless severe):
   - Style preferences
   - Minor optimizations
   - Subjective improvements

### Comment Quality Rules

**STRICT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **NO positive-only comments** - Never comment just to say code is good
- **Actionable feedback only** - Every comment must suggest a specific improvement
- **Focus on changed code** - Only comment on lines that were modified in this PR
- **Minimum impact threshold** - Only comment if the issue significantly affects functionality, security, performance, or maintainability

**Quality Guidelines:**
- Aim for 3-7 high-impact comments maximum for a typical PR
- Skip redundant comments on similar issues
- Provide clear explanations of why the issue matters
- Include specific code suggestions when possible

## LINE TARGETING - CRITICAL ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS

### How to Determine Correct Line Numbers

**STEP 1: Locate the Change in Git Diff**
- Find the specific hunk in the Git Diff that contains the code you want to comment on
- Look for lines starting with `+` (additions) or context lines (no prefix)
- Note the line numbers shown in the hunk header (e.g., `@@ -10,5 +10,8 @@`)

**STEP 2: Calculate Target Line Numbers**
- For **single-line comments**: Use the exact line number from the diff
- For **multi-line comments**: Use `start_line` and `line` to define the range
- **ONLY comment on lines that appear in the Git Diff** (either as additions `+` or context lines)

**STEP 3: Validate Your Line Numbers**
- Double-check that your target lines correspond to actual changes in the diff
- Ensure the line numbers make sense within the file structure
- If uncertain about line positioning, skip the comment rather than guess

### Line Number Examples

**Example 1 - Single Line Comment:**
```diff
@@ -15,3 +15,4 @@ function processData(input) {
   if (!input) {
     return null
   }
+  return input.toUpperCase() // New line at line 18
```
→ Comment on line 18

**Example 2 - Multi-Line Comment:**
```diff
@@ -20,5 +20,8 @@ function validateUser(user) {
-  if (user.name) {
-    return true
-  }
+  if (!user || !user.name || user.name.trim() === '') {
+    throw new Error('Invalid user')
+  }
+  return true
```
→ Comment on lines 21-24 (start_line: 21, line: 24)

## Code Suggestions - SEARCH/REPLACE Block Format

When providing code suggestions, use SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for precise modifications.

### SEARCH/REPLACE Block Rules

**Critical Requirements:**
1. **Exact Matching**: SEARCH content must match the file content character-for-character
2. **Sufficient Context**: Include enough surrounding lines to uniquely identify the location
3. **Complete Lines**: Each line in SEARCH blocks must be complete, never truncated
4. **Diff Alignment**: Ensure your SEARCH blocks target code that appears in the Git Diff

### Usage Examples

**Single Line Change:**
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils/helper.ts",
  "line": 15,
  "body": "This function should handle null values to prevent runtime errors.",
  "search_replace_blocks": [
    {
      "search": "  return user.name.toUpperCase()",
      "replace": "  return user?.name?.toUpperCase() ?? 'Unknown'"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Multi-Line Change with Context:**
```json
{
  "path": "src/components/Form.tsx",
  "line": 27,
  "start_line": 25,
  "body": "Add proper error handling and validation to this form submission.",
  "search_replace_blocks": [
    {
      "search": "const handleSubmit = () => {\n  saveData(formData)\n  setLoading(false)\n}",
      "replace": "const handleSubmit = async () => {\n  try {\n    setLoading(true)\n    await saveData(formData)\n    setSuccess(true)\n  } catch (error) {\n    setError(error.message)\n  } finally {\n    setLoading(false)\n  }\n}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Best Practices for SEARCH/REPLACE Blocks

- **Include Context**: Add 1-2 lines before/after the target code for unique identification
- **Match Exactly**: Copy the exact indentation, spacing, and formatting from the file
- **Test Mentally**: Verify your SEARCH block would uniquely match only the intended location
- **Order Correctly**: List multiple blocks in the order they appear in the file

### When NOT to Use SEARCH/REPLACE Blocks

- When you cannot see the exact code content to match
- For conceptual suggestions that don't involve specific code replacement
- When the change requires understanding broader context not visible in the diff

## Response Format Requirements

You MUST use the "provide_code_review" tool with:

### Summary Requirements
- Concise overview focusing on the most important aspects
- Highlight critical issues that need immediate attention
- Mention the overall quality and any patterns observed

### Comment Requirements
- **Accurate line targeting**: Use the Git Diff to determine correct line numbers
- **Specific file paths**: Match exactly as shown in the diff
- **Clear problem description**: Explain what's wrong and why it matters
- **Actionable solutions**: Provide concrete steps to fix the issue
- **SEARCH/REPLACE blocks**: Include when you can provide exact code fixes

### Line Number Validation Checklist
Before submitting each comment, verify:
- [ ] The target lines appear in the Git Diff
- [ ] Line numbers correspond to actual changes or context lines
- [ ] Multi-line ranges are correctly specified (start_line ≤ line)
- [ ] SEARCH blocks would uniquely match the intended code location

## Important Notes

- **Accuracy over quantity**: Better to have fewer, precisely targeted comments than many misaligned ones
- **Skip if uncertain**: If you cannot determine accurate line numbers, skip the comment
- **Focus on impact**: Only comment on issues that genuinely improve code quality
- **Use the diff**: The Git Diff is your source of truth for line positioning

Remember: A well-positioned, actionable comment is infinitely more valuable than a misaligned one that confuses developers.

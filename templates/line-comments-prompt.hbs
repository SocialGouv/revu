2. Provide thorough critique by identifying:
   - Code quality issues (readability, maintainability)
   - Potential bugs
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
   - Design problems
   - Opportunities for improvement

3. IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in the following structured JSON format:

```json
{
  "summary": "An overall summary of the PR, explaining the changes and providing a general assessment",
  "comments": [
    {
      "path": "path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 42,
      "body": "Detailed comment explaining the issue or suggestion",
      "suggestion": "Suggested code to fix the issue (optional)"
    },
    // Additional comments...
  ]
}
```

Where:
- "summary": Provides an overview of the PR, its strengths and weaknesses
- "comments": An array of specific comments where:
  - "path": The file path relative to the repository root
  - "line": The line number where the comment applies
  - "body": The detailed comment (be precise and constructive)
  - "suggestion": A proposed improved code (optional)

## Important Notes

- Be precise about line numbers. Make sure they correspond to the actual lines in the files after modifications.
- Focus on significant issues rather than minor style or convention concerns.
- Provide clear, educational explanations for each comment, not just identifying the problem.
- Ensure your response is strictly valid JSON that can be directly parsed.
- Do not include the ```json tag at the beginning or ``` at the end in your response.

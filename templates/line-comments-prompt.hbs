## Instructions

1. Analyze the modified code and git differences to understand the changes made.
2. Provide thorough critique by identifying:
   - Code quality issues (readability, maintainability)
   - Potential bugs
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
   - Design problems
   - Opportunities for improvement

3. IMPORTANT: Your review should consist of MULTIPLE LINE-SPECIFIC COMMENTS rather than a single global comment. Each issue or suggestion should be tied to a specific line of code where the problem exists.

4. You MUST use the provided "provide_code_review" tool to format your response. This is critical because:
   - It allows us to place each of your comments at the exact relevant line in the code
   - It enables developers to see comments in context, directly in their editor
   - It facilitates addressing each issue individually during the review process

5. When using the "provide_code_review" tool, make sure to provide:
   - A comprehensive overall summary of the PR in the "summary" field
   - Multiple specific comments targeting different issues with accurate file paths and line numbers
   - For single-line comments: use only the "line" parameter
   - For multi-line comments: use both "start_line" and "line" parameters (start_line must be â‰¤ line)
   - Use multi-line comments when your feedback applies to a range of consecutive lines
   - Detailed explanations in each comment's body
   - Code suggestions where appropriate

## Important Notes

- Be precise about line numbers. Make sure they correspond to the actual lines in the files after modifications.
- Focus on significant issues rather than minor style or convention concerns.
- Provide clear, educational explanations for each comment, not just identifying the problem.

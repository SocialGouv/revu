## Analysis Instructions

Your task is to analyze this PR and detect concrete, actionable issues. Focus on identifying specific problems that genuinely need attention.

### Issue Detection Guidelines

**Focus on Concrete Issues:**
- Look for actual problems, not theoretical concerns
- Identify specific code that needs improvement
- Avoid vague or subjective observations
- Prioritize issues that affect functionality, security, or maintainability

**Issue Categories:**
- `security`: Vulnerabilities, input validation, authentication issues
- `performance`: Inefficiencies, bottlenecks, resource usage problems
- `bug`: Logic errors, incorrect implementations, edge case failures
- `maintainability`: Code clarity, documentation, modularity issues
- `style`: Coding standard violations, formatting inconsistencies
- `testing`: Missing tests, inadequate coverage, test quality issues

**Severity Levels:**
- `critical`: Must be fixed (security vulnerabilities, breaking bugs)
- `high`: Should be fixed (performance issues, significant bugs)
- `medium`: Good to fix (maintainability, minor bugs)
- `low`: Optional (style preferences, minor improvements)

### For Each Issue You Find:

1. **Provide specifics:**
   - Exact file path and line number (where the issue starts)
   - Clear title and description of what's wrong and why
   - Relevant code snippet with surrounding context

2. **Suggest a fix:**
   - Single, clear description of how to fix the issue
   - Optional code example showing the improved version
   - Focus on practical, actionable solutions

3. **Be selective:**
   - Only flag genuine problems that need attention
   - Don't create issues for acceptable code variations
   - Consider the PR's context and goals

## CRITICAL: Tool Usage Requirement

**YOU MUST USE THE PROVIDED TOOL TO RESPOND**

You have been provided with a tool called `provide_review_plan`. You MUST use this tool to provide your response. Do NOT respond with plain text or JSON in a code block.

**MANDATORY**: Call the `provide_review_plan` tool with your analysis structured as an array of issue objects:

```json
{
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "unique-issue-id",
      "file_path": "exact/path/to/file.ts",
      "line": 15,
      "issue_type": "security|performance|bug|maintainability|style|testing",
      "severity": "critical|high|medium|low",
      "title": "Brief, descriptive title",
      "description": "Detailed explanation of the issue and its impact",
      "context": "Relevant code snippet with surrounding context showing the problem",
      "suggested_fix": "Clear description of how to fix this issue",
      "code_suggestion": "Optional improved code example"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Important Notes

- **Be specific**: Every issue should reference exact code locations
- **Be actionable**: Every issue should have a concrete solution
- **Be selective**: Only flag genuine problems that need attention
- **Be thorough**: Examine all aspects of the changes (logic, security, performance, etc.)
- **Provide context**: Include enough code context for someone else to understand the issue

Your analysis will directly drive the comment generation phase, so focus on providing clear, actionable insights that can be turned into helpful review comments.

# Revu - AI-Powered Code Review Assistant

Revu is a GitHub App that leverages Anthropic's Claude AI to provide intelligent, context-aware code reviews for pull requests. By analyzing the entire codebase, changes, and commit history, Revu offers comprehensive feedback that goes beyond simple style checks.

## Features

- **Contextual Analysis**: Understands code changes in the context of the entire codebase
- **Intelligent Feedback**: Provides detailed explanations and suggestions for improvements
- **Git-Aware**: Considers commit history and branch differences
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub's PR workflow
- **Customizable**: Configurable through environment variables, templates, and coding guidelines
- **Coding Guidelines**: Enforce custom coding standards through configuration
- **Smart Comment Management**: Automatically cleans up obsolete comments to prevent accumulation across commits

## How It Works

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[PR Created/Updated] --> B[Extract Data]
    B --> C[Codebase Analysis]
    B --> D[PR Diff]
    B --> E[Git History]
    C --> F[Generate Prompt]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Claude Analysis]
    G --> H[Post PR Comment]
```

1. **Trigger**: When a PR is opened or updated
2. **Data Collection**:
   - Extracts full codebase for context
   - Generates diff to focus on changes
   - Retrieves git history for background
3. **Analysis**:
   - Combines data into a structured prompt
   - Sends to Claude for intelligent analysis
4. **Feedback**: Posts detailed review comments on the PR

## Smart Comment Management

Revu features intelligent comment management that prevents comment accumulation across commits, ensuring PR pages remain fast and readable.

### How It Works

- **Automatic Cleanup**: When a new commit is pushed, Revu analyzes which existing comments are still relevant
- **Diff-Based Logic**: Comments are only kept if they refer to lines that are still part of the current diff
- **Safe Deletion**: Only removes comments created by Revu (identified by unique markers)
- **Performance Optimization**: Prevents GitHub PR pages from becoming slow or unresponsive due to comment overload

### Benefits

- **Faster PR Pages**: No more slow-loading PR pages due to accumulated comments
- **Relevant Feedback**: Only shows comments that are still applicable to the current code
- **Clean Interface**: Maintains a clean, focused review experience
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality remains unchanged

### Technical Details

The cleanup process runs automatically before creating new comments and:

1. Fetches all existing review comments with Revu markers
2. Compares comment locations with the current diff
3. Removes comments on lines no longer in the diff
4. Preserves comments that are still relevant
5. Reports cleanup actions in the response

## Multi-line Comment Support

Revu supports both single-line and multi-line code review comments, allowing for more contextual and precise feedback on code blocks.

### Features

- **Single-line Comments**: Target specific lines for focused feedback
- **Multi-line Comments**: Span multiple consecutive lines for broader context
- **Intelligent Validation**: Automatically validates that start_line â‰¤ line
- **Smart Cleanup**: Multi-line comments are preserved only if ALL lines in the range are still in the diff
- **GitHub Integration**: Uses GitHub's native multi-line comment API

### Usage Examples

#### Single-line Comment
```json
{
  "path": "src/utils.ts",
  "line": 42,
  "body": "Consider using a more descriptive variable name here"
}
```

#### Multi-line Comment
```json
{
  "path": "src/auth.ts", 
  "line": 25,
  "start_line": 20,
  "body": "This entire authentication block could be refactored into a separate function for better readability"
}
```

### When to Use Multi-line Comments

- **Code Blocks**: When feedback applies to an entire function, loop, or conditional block
- **Related Lines**: When multiple consecutive lines share the same issue
- **Contextual Feedback**: When the comment needs to reference the relationship between multiple lines
- **Refactoring Suggestions**: When suggesting changes that affect a range of lines

### Technical Implementation

Multi-line comments use GitHub's review comment API with additional parameters:
- `start_line`: The first line of the comment range
- `line`: The last line of the comment range  
- `side`: Set to 'RIGHT' for the new version of the file
- `start_side`: Set to 'RIGHT' for consistency

The cleanup system intelligently handles multi-line comments by checking that all lines in the range (start_line to line) are still present in the current diff before preserving the comment.

## CLI Usage for Testing

For testing purposes, you can review closed PRs without waiting for PR events using the CLI:

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Review a PR by URL (prints analysis to console only)
yarn review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123

# Specify a different review strategy
yarn review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --strategy line-comments

# Submit comments to GitHub after analysis
yarn review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --submit

# Specify a different review strategy
yarn review-pr https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 --strategy line-comments
```

### Authentication for Private Repositories

To review private repositories, you need to set up GitHub App (Revu) authentication:

1. Set the following environment variables:
   - `APP_ID`: Your GitHub App ID
   - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Revu's private key (including BEGIN/END markers)

2. Make sure your Revu is installed on the repositories you want to review

By default, the CLI will output the analysis results to the console only, making it easy to test and debug the review process. When the `--submit` flag is provided, it will also post comments to GitHub using the appropriate comment handler based on the strategy.

```

### Configuration

#### Model Configuration

- Model: Claude 3 Sonnet
- Max tokens: 4096
- Temperature: 0.7
- Required env: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

#### Coding Guidelines Configuration

Revu supports custom coding guidelines through a `.revu.yml` YAML configuration file in the project root:

```yaml
# .revu.yml file structure
codingGuidelines:
  - "Test coverage: Critical code requires 100% test coverage; non-critical paths require 60% coverage."
  - "Naming: Use semantically significant names for functions, classes, and parameters."
  - "Comments: Add comments only for complex code; simple code should be self-explanatory."
  - "Documentation: Public functions must have concise docstrings explaining purpose and return values."

reviewSettings:
  # Future configuration options for review behavior
```

The configuration supports:

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Organized by configuration type
- **User Overrides**: Repository-specific `.revu.yml` files can override default settings
- **Extensible Design**: Ready for future configuration options

Guidelines are automatically included in code review comments to ensure consistent standards across your projects.

## File Filtering with .revuignore

Revu supports intelligent file filtering to exclude irrelevant files from code review analysis, improving both performance and review quality. This is accomplished through `.revuignore` files that work similarly to `.gitignore` files.

### How It Works

When analyzing a repository, Revu automatically filters out files that match patterns in `.revuignore` files before sending them to the AI for review. This ensures that:

- Lock files (`yarn.lock`, `package-lock.json`) are ignored
- Generated files (`dist/`, `build/`, `*.min.js`) are skipped
- Dependencies (`node_modules/`) are excluded
- Temporary and cache files are filtered out

### Default Filtering

Revu includes a comprehensive default `.revuignore` file that covers common patterns:

```gitignore
# Lock files
*.lock
yarn.lock
package-lock.json
pnpm-lock.yaml

# Generated files
dist/
build/
*.min.js
*.map

# Dependencies
node_modules/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp

# Build artifacts
*.o
*.so
*.dylib
*.dll
*.exe

# Logs
*.log
logs/

# Coverage reports
coverage/
*.lcov
```

### Custom Repository Filtering

To customize file filtering for a specific repository, create a `.revuignore` file in the repository root

### Priority System

Revu prioritizes a repository's own `.revuignore` file over its built-in defaults when filtering files.

### Best Practices

1. **Include generated files**: Always exclude files that are automatically generated
2. **Filter dependencies**: Exclude third-party code that doesn't need review
3. **Skip build artifacts**: Don't review compiled or minified files
4. **Exclude test fixtures**: Large test data files rarely need AI review
5. **Document patterns**: Use comments to explain complex exclusion patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Webhook Not Receiving Events**
   - Verify smee.io proxy is running
   - Check webhook URL in GitHub App settings
   - Ensure correct port forwarding

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Validate ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - Check GitHub App credentials
   - Verify private key format

3. **Repository Access Issues**
   - Confirm GitHub App installation
   - Check repository permissions
   - Verify REPOSITORY_FOLDER path exists

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
DEBUG=revu:* yarn dev
```
